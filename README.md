# Drivers of extreme carbon fluxes
## Introduction

## Objectives
 Determine which environmental variables are important predictors of daily fluxes, and do these important variables differ among different flux components (e.g., NEE, GPP, ET)? Use flux data to define “extreme flux classes” or “syndromes”, such as exceptionally high and low GPP and ET, and exceptionally high (in magnitude) and low (near zero) NEE. What environmental predictors are the most important for predicting the extreme flux syndromes, and do these align across flux types (NEE, GPP, ET) or with the important predictors of actual fluxes? Explore the potential importance of concurrent and lagged environmental conditions.
