# Drivers of extreme carbon fluxes
## Introduction

## Objectives
 (1) Determine which environmental variables are important predictors of daily fluxes, and do these important variables differ among different flux components (GPP and Reco). 
 (2) Use flux data to define “extreme flux classes” or “syndromes”, including high/low GPP, high/low Reco, and inactivity (low GPP & Reco). Investigate how important environmental predictors vary between the extreme states of these flux measurements.
 (3) What environmental predictors are the most important for predicting the extreme flux syndromes inside and outside of the growing season, and do these align across flux types (GPP, Reco)? 
 (4) Determine how timescales of importance vary between predicting GPP and Reco extremes and how 

## Workflow
- Identify flux towers to work on.
