This file holds results for some old models ran. Refer to ReadME to find which cases correlate with which models.
Many (but not all) of the original model outputs are saved to a google drive, so if you really need them feel free to reach out.
You can always reach out to me if you really need to find some results, although I doubt you really will. 
Most valuable information will be in the results tables, which have the VIMP's for the extreme state category specifically as well as its misclassifications. 
Enjoy!
