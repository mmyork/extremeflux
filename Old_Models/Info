This file holds all the files for old models that were ran. I compiled as much as I could, but it is not complete. 
You can always reach out to me if you really need to find some results, although I doubt you really will. 
Most valuable information will be in the results tables, which have the VIMP's for the extreme state category specifically as well as its misclassifications. 
Enjoy!
